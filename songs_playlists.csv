El mundo nos quiere, nos quiere, y me quiere a mí
Toda mi gente se mueve
Mira el ritmo cómo los tiene

Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh-na-na

All of my heart is in Havana
There's somethin' 'bout his manners
Havana, ooh-na-na
He didn't walk up with that ""How you doin'?""

3,Blessed,Obama's Favorite Songs of 2017,"Everywhere that I go, everywhere that I be
If you are not surrounding me with your energy
I don't wanna be there, don't wanna be anywhere
Any place that I can't feel you, I just wanna be near you
And yes, I'm a mess but I'm blessed
To be stuck with you
Sometimes it gets unhealthy
We can't be by ourselves, we
We'll always need each other, and
Yes, I'm a mess but I'm blessed
To be stuck with you
I just want you to know that
If I could I swear I'll go back
Make everything all better, whoa
It's the things that you say
It's the way that you pray
Pray on my insecurities
I know you're feeling me
I know sometimes I do wrong
But hear the words of this song
When I go I don't stay gone for long
Don't know what's going on
And yes, I'm a mess but I'm blessed
To be stuck with you
Sometimes it gets unhealthy
We can't be by ourselves, we
We'll always need each other, and
Yes, I'm a mess but I'm blessed
To be stuck with you
I just want you to know that

4,The Joke,Obama's Favorite Songs of 2017,"You're feeling nervous, aren't you, boy?
With your quiet voice and impeccable style
Don't ever let them steal your joy
And your gentle ways, to keep 'em from running wild
They can kick dirt in your face
Dress you down, and tell you that your place
Is in the middle, when they hate the way you shine
I see you tugging on your shirt
Trying to hide inside of it and hide how much it hurts
Let 'em laugh while they can
Let 'em spin, let 'em scatter in the wind
I have been to the movies, I've seen how it ends
And the joke's on them
You get discouraged, don't you, girl?
It's your brother's world for a while longer
We gotta dance with the devil on a river
To beat the stream
Call it living the dream, call it kicking the ladder
They come to kick dirt in your face
To call you weak and then displace you
After carrying your baby on your back across the desert
I saw your eyes behind your hair
And you're looking tired, but you don't look scared
Let 'em laugh while they can
Let 'em spin, let 'em scatter in the wind
I have been to the movies, I've seen how it ends
And the joke's on them
Let 'em laugh while they can
Let 'em spin, let 'em scatter in the wind
I have been to the movies, I've seen how it ends
And the joke's on them",english
5,Rise Up,Obama's Favorite Songs of 2017,"You're broken down and tired
Of living life on a merry go round

And move mountains
We gonna walk it out
And move mountains
And I'll rise up
I'll rise like the day

For you

When the silence isn't quiet
And it feels like it's getting hard to breathe
And I know you feel like dying
But I promise we'll take the world to its feet
And move mountains
We'll take it to its feet
And move mountains
And I'll rise up
I'll rise like the day
I'll rise up
I'll rise unafraid

And I'll do it a thousand times again

8,La Dame et Ses Valises,Obama's Favorite Songs of 2017,"Turn me up

As we work, we look we lose
Because when things go wrong we still be strong

No matter what they bring we still believe
Because when things go wrong we still be here
Feel me on my way or hand it to, what’s your baggage?
With all this mind I want to see your baggage

When things are hard you must work great
Because when things go hard you beat on your head

I see the way you work your hurt
Because you’ve been inside that darkness for too long
Woman don’t you know you’re a queen
As you the queen is always gone, so keep it clean
But you sure remind them what they have done to you

You must walk out
You can go wrong in this, you can’t go on
Turn me up

As we walk we work we lose
Because when things go wrong we still be strong
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open
Keep your bags on the road

9,Unforgettable,Obama's Favorite Songs of 2017,"It's not good enough for me, since I been with you
It's not gonna work for you, nobody can equal me
I'm gonna sip on this drink, when I'm fucked up
I should know how to pick up
I'm gonna catch the rhythm while she push up against me
Ooh, and she tipsy
I had enough convo for 24
I peep'd you from across the room
Pretty little body, dancing like GoGo, aye
But you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone
Why not?
A fucking good time, never hurt nobody
I got a little drink but it's not Bacardi
If you loved the girl then I'm so, so sorry
I got to give it to her like we in a marriage
Oh, like we in a hurry
No, no I won't tell nobody
You're on your level too
Tryna do what lovers do
Feelin' like I'm fresh out, Boosie
If they want the drama, got the Uzi
Ship the whole crew to the cruise ship
Doin' shit you don't even see in movies
Ride with me
Ride with me, boss
I got a hard head but her ass soft
She want the last name with the ring on it
'Cause I pulled out a million cash, told her plank on it
You are unforgettable
I wanna get you alone
Now you wanna chose
Just popped bubbly in the 'cuzi
It's not good enough for me, since I been with you
I'm gonna sip on this drink, when I'm fucked up

Alone
Baby go and grab some bad bitches, bring 'em home
Know the jet's on me
I'ma curve my best for you
You know, so pick up that dress for me
Leave the rest home
Too much combo 24 hours
When you stand next to 24 karats
She left her man at home
She don't love him no more
I want your mind and your body
Don't mind nobody
So as long you don't never hurt nobody
Baby girl work your body
Work your body
And you are unforgettable
I need get you alone
Now you wanna chose
Just popped bubbly in the 'cuzi
Right now

10,The System Only Dreams in Total Darkness,Obama's Favorite Songs of 2017,"Maybe I listen more than you think
And I can tell that somebody sold you
We said we've never let anyone in
We said we'd only die of lonely secrets
The system only dreams in total darkness
Why are you hiding from me?
We're in a different kind of thing now
All night you're talking to God
I thought that this would all work out after a while
Now you're saying that I'm asking for too much attention
Also no other faith is light enough for this place
We said we'd only die of lonely secrets
The system only dreams in total darkness
Why are you hiding from me?
We're in a different kind of thing now
All night you're talking to God
And I cannot explain it
Oh, any other, any other way
I cannot explain it
Oh, any other, any other way
The system only dreams in total darkness
Why are you hiding from me?

And he got fight stories to tell
I see both sides like Chanel
See on both sides like Chanel

Heated like I'm underworld
Hide my tattoos in Shibuya
Police think I'm of the underworld
12 treat a nigga like he 12
How you looking up to me and talking down?
Can't you see I am the big man? (Big man)
God level I am the I am (whoa)
Now film it with that drone cam
In the pink like Killa Cam
Put a zoom on that stick, Noé
Up so close I'm on that kill
Remote controller on your lower back
Yes the good
Dick could roll the eyes back in the skull
Rolling when you ride, poppin'
Rolling when you ride
Ride the Rodman
Got one that's straight acting
Turnt out like some dirty plastic (Ride)
2016 burnt some discs
2017 ideas playing off a Walkman
This a cult not a clique on the net
With a cup in a cup, Actavis
That's a double edge, ""issa knife""
And I don't like to fight 'til I'm fighting
Revenge in the air make my lungs sick
Chopper in the sky like a gun trick
Clips on clips like Mike
It's really all
I see both sides like Chanel
See on both sides like Chanel
It's really you on my mind
It's really you on my mind
It's really you
It's really you on my mind
V both sides of the 12
Steam both sides of the L
Freeze smoke rings and they hail
Sleet snow grind for the wealth
Whole team diamonds is real
Showed 'em how to shine by they selves
You need a cosign for your health
I need that bitch to grind on my belt
I know you need to try for my belt
I know you seen it driving itself
No matte black on the ride 'cause it's stale
But it's stealth
I see both sides like Chanel
I see both sides like Chanel
My pockets snug
They can't hold my 7
They banned my Visa
My Amex and Mastercards
I got new money
And it's all cash
I got new bags

Amazing the cash online unknown
I mean my baby boy
Blazing the dash counting money at home

Goodbye to my hopes and dreams
Stop flipping for my enemies
We could wait until the walls come down

Kids in the middle, but oh 'til it falls
Won't bother me

Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming back?

16,Millionaire,Obama's Favorite Songs of 2017,"They say ""Love is more precious than gold""
Can't be bought and it can't be sold
I got love enough to spare
That makes me a millionaire
I got a woman with eyes that shine
Down deep as a diamond mine
She's my treasure so very rare
She's made me a millionaire
When we ride around, ride around this old town
In the beat-up car, with the windows down
People look at her and they look at me
And say ""That boy is sure living in luxury""
Sweet luxury
'Cause love is more precious than gold
It can't be bought, no, never could be sold
I got love enough to share
That makes me a millionaire
When the kisses fall from everywhere
Life reaches on, millionaire
When the pocket's are empty and the cupboard is bare
I still feel like a millionaire
'Cause love is more precious than gold
It can't be bought, no, and it can't be sold
I got love enough to spare
That makes me a millionaire",english

19,Ordinary Love - Extraordinary Mix,Obama's Favorite Songs of 2017,"The sea wants to kiss the golden shore
The sunlight warms your skin
All the beauty that's been lost before
Wants to find us again

I can't fight you anymore
It's you I'm fighting for
The sea throws rocks together
But time leaves us polished stones

We can't fall any further
If we can't feel ordinary love
And we cannot reach any higher
If we can't deal with ordinary love

Birds fly high in the summer sky
And rest on the breeze
The same wind will take care of you and I
We'll build our house in the trees

Your heart is on my sleeve
Did you put it there with a magic marker
For years I would believe
That the world couldn't wash it away

'Cause we can't fall any further
If we can't feel ordinary love
And we cannot reach any higher
If we can't deal with ordinary love

'Cause we can't fall any further
If we can't feel ordinary love
And we cannot reach any higher
If we can't deal with ordinary love

We can't fall any further
If we can't feel ordinary love
And we cannot reach any higher
If we can't deal with ordinary love

Are we tough enough for ordinary love
Are we tough enough, tough enough for love
Are we tough enough for ordinary love",english

After all, maybe I should thank you
For giving me what I've found

I've been doing just fine
Except for any time I hear that song

Did it ever cross your mind that one day the tables would be turned?
They told me the best revenge would be a life well lived
And the strongest one that holds would be the hardest one to earn

Slip me a xanny at once (somebody)
I got the earth in a blunt (smoke)
I get the skirt when I want (skrrt!)
I get the skirt when I want (skrrt!)
Due to the money aroma (somebody)
My girl she got a diploma (smoke)
She got wife written all over
She got wife written all over
All a nigga know is how to fuck a good thing up
Run from the pain, sip lean, smoke tree up
When I'm in your town press pound hit me up
When I'm in your town press pound hit me up
Only if you down and you slurp good D up
If the work good I'll be back for the re-up
Hate when I creep and the phone wake me up
Fake like I'm sleep knowing damn well I be up
Monkey on my back and I walk a hundred miles
Guilt make a nigga feel fake when he smile
Love get confused in the mind of a child
'Cause love wouldn't lie like I lie and it's wild
Wanna have my cake and another cake too
Even if the baker don't bake like you
Even when the flavor don't taste like you
So I'm back mobbing with the late night crew
All in your mind with fears that would come true
The back of my mind, the back of my mind was you
Wishing that I could blind myself from view
And only have eyes, and only have eyes for you
Slip me a xanny at once (somebody)
I got the earth in a blunt (smoke)
I get the skirt when I want (skrrt!)
I get the skirt when I want (skrrt!)
Due to the money aroma (somebody)
My girl she got a diploma (smoke)
She got wife written all over
She got wife written all over
I'm a fake nigga and it's never been clearer
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
I'm a fake nigga and it's never been clearer
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
She my number one I don't need nothing on the side
Said that I was done for good and don't want no more lies
But my phone be blowing up, temptations on my line
I stare at the screen a while before I press decline
But she plants a seed and it still lingers in my mind
Told myself I'm strong enough to shake it and I'm trying
But I'm only human, I know loving you's a crime
If I take this cookie now one day I'll do the time
I love her, I don't want to lose her
I'm selfish, I know that I use her
My ego get stroked and I bruise her
My ego get stroked and I bruise her
My actions I know they confusin'
At home I look happy as usual
On the road I'm a mack, I'm a chooser
I'm a addict, I'm maskin' that
Kevin's Heart
They tell me ""What's done in the dark
Will find a way to shine""
I done did so much that when you see you might go blind
What's done in the dark will always find a way to shine
I done did so much that when you see you might go blind",english

?, shit
Yeah
Loved you all a long, long while
Looked down into a deep, dark well
Called all your names
They echoed down for miles and miles
And all that other mystical, well, never-you-mind
Loved them all through many a lifetime
Some are gone but some still strong
Some are weird as hell but we love 'em
Some are one trick ponies but we embrace 'em
'Cause I've always had a soft spot for repetition
Wooh, loved you all a long, long while
Looked down into a deep, dark well
Called all your names
They echoed down for miles and miles
And all that other mystical, well, never-you-mind
Loved you all a long, long time
Looked long into the length of a tunnel
Called all your names
And we was tripping out 'cause we needed a way out
And all them other crystalline mystic rationalizations
Loved them all right down to my soul
Looked well into the depth of a hole
Pondered perpetual motion in the echo
Just like the song if the repeats were long
Loved you all a long, long while
Looked down into a deep, dark well
Called all your names
They echoed down for miles and miles
And all that other mystical, well, never-you-mind
Loved you all a long, long while
And I'd give my left, nevermind, for one big synchronized smile
Some are one trick ponies but so am I
Round 'em up into a mixed bag bundle of love now, yeah
Loved them all a long, long tick
And it's four, five, six
Prevent your schtick
Throw them at the wall in a mixed bag and see if they stick
Then give 'em a glass of water
Give 'em a cherry pie
Wooh, loved you all a long, long while
Looked down into a deep, dark well
Called all your names
They echoed down for miles and miles
And all that other mystical, well, never-you-mind",english

Bottle of Henny on my body that
Can somebody tell me where the party at?

Always tryna make everybody feel special
Learning when to brake and when to hit the pedal
Working hard to look good 'til we die
A critical reason there's a population
Raising our brows at a new generation
Rosie the Riveter with renovations
And always gets better with wine
Redesigning women
Running the world while we're cleaning up the kitchen
Making bank, shaking hands, driving 80
Tryna get home just to feed the baby
Skipping the bread for the butter
Changing our minds like we change our hair color
Yeah, ever since the beginning
We've been redesigning women
Pulling up the floors and changing out the curtains
Some of us are saints and some of us are surgeons
Made in God's image, just a better version
And breaking every jello mold
And when we love someone we take 'em to Heaven
And if the shoe fits, we're gonna buy 11
How'd we get it done? We like to keep 'em guessing
But secretly we all know
Redesigning women
Running the world while we're cleaning up the kitchen
Making bank, shaking hands, driving 80
Tryna get home just to feed the baby
Skipping the bread for the butter
Changing our minds like we change our hair color

Making it up as we go along

Some of them wouldn't lay me low

Some I've never seen again
Some of them they wanna be your friend
This was a different kind of love
Some of them I really, really, really blew
And some of it was all in vain
Some of them were blowing over before I knew
I need a different kind of love
Sometimes the only solace I can find is my old faded dreams
Can I get unstuck?

I need a different kind of love

What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?

Get my niggas more chips
Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist

Back when the rap game was praying I'd diss
They act like two legends cannot coexist
But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothing
If I smoke a rapper

It won't be for clout
It won't be for fame
It won't be 'cause my shit ain't selling the same

I hope that you scrape every dollar you can
I hope you know money won't erase the pain

Was watching you when you was paving the ground
I copied your cadence
I mirrored your style
I studied the greats
I'm the greatest right now

Look at my skills, running through blocks like 49ers
Forty-nine diamonds, stuffed in my bracelet
That cost a whop, that cost a whopper
And it ain't new, I had a knot at John Ehret in my locker

Under streetlights
In the city of palms
Call me what you want, when you want, if you want
And you can call me names if you call me up
I can't fix each and all your problems
I'm no good with names and faces
She sent me naked pictures
From her neck down to the waist
I get my feelings involved
She stopped returnin' my calls
Flaws turned into walls and barricades
And I'm too fucked on and over both ways
And now every long day is a bad one
I can't make you call or make you stay
Or take you off the pedestal
So I get lost in modern music watchin' movies
Talkin' to the walls in my room
Walkin' through the halls in my head
Just tryna make sure it all makes sense
I ain't made of money
Maybe someday you could take it from me
I'm up too late
Thinkin' bout you
In MIA for
Three nights at the motel

Please don't leave me girl,
Don't you go,
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby,
Please don't leave me, girl,

Now I've heard a cryin' man
Is half a man with no sense of pride,
But if I have to cry to keep you,
I don't mind weepin' if it'll keep you by my side.
Ain't too proud to beg and you know it,
Please don't leave me girl,
Don't you go,
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby,
Please don't leave me, girl,
Don't you go.
If I have to sleep on your doorstep all night and day
Just to keep you from walking away,
Let your friends laugh, even this I can stand,
'cause I wanna keep you any way I can.
Ain't too proud to beg and you know it,

Now I've got a love so deep in the pit of my heart,
And each day it grows more and more,
I'm not ashamed to call and plead to you, baby,
If pleading keeps you from walking out that door.

81,Memories Live,The President's Summer Playlist: Day,"Yo, you know what we got to do, man, we need to get a whole cd
Get a collection of all the music and everything we've ever done
Bringing back sweet memories
Life, living in flatbush and going to house parties
Red lights, bumping, life is what you make it, then sorry
In my lifetime, ain't done too many things
Better than watching your first son put his sentences together
Yo, it kinda make me think of way back when
I was the portrait of the artist as a young man
All them teenage dreams of rapping
Writing rhymes on napkins
Was really visualization
Making this shit actually happen
It's like something come through me
That truly just consume me
Speaking through the voices of the spirits speaking to me
I think back in the day, I absorbed everything like a sponge
Took a plunge into my past to share with my son
Bringing back sweet memories
Like thoughts out the back of my mind
Going back in some time
Like when you used to cut and had to go to the back of the line
Look back and you find
Tracks that make you relax and recline
Now cats rap about packing a nine
When they lacking divine
Inspiration
Running out of topics of conversation
Well I drop it in the pocket because rocking's my occupation
I do it remarkably, spark up a leaf
And possibly you could follow me
Tap into your chi
Utilize your memory
To help you see clearly, then get back to me
Actually, nothing's new under the sun
So when life be stressing me
My remedy is 'bringing back sweet memories'
Like the faces that are woven in the fabric of my consciousness
From cities where making 21's a big accomplishment
Like when my people understood their prominence
And my past life visions of the continent
Like the first time I saw krs live, rockin' it
I heard resurrection by common sense
Dominant in my psyche
I chose my direction like spike lee
To speak my life through mics, and I never take it lightly
It might be something you did to bring you down when you were high
But that karma's a bitch, you steady asking god why
Like when my parents first split up
Yo, I was illin'
Seems like some years they was together for the sake of the children
And I love them for that
I don't know if they saw that
So I'mma say it, and convey it when the world play it (3x)
Bringing back sweet memories
Like black is beautiful, names from the seventies
Let me tap into your energy
Fields of dreams become my property
When I reach my destiny like a prophecy
Especially when I 'm 'bringing back sweet memories'
I got deep into my mind, see I got a treasury
That float through my head like a sweet melody
What you telling me
Reflection is a collection of memories
Definitely this is how hiphop was meant to be
Eventually, I knew I'd run into hi-teknology
It was only a matter of time like centuries
Check the recipe or technique to how it sound so sweet
I freak with word power, my man speak with beats
If I could make it in new york, I figured anywhere I'd make it
Came to cincinnati linked with mood, and we did sacred
Hi-tek beats became my favorite
Hustle on the side was the cut
We started to put songs together like 'what!'
Traveled the world, came back to the crib
And hit the motherland
Yeah, this year we put in work and got some other plans
In fact, that's where I'll take the fam
When the reflection joint is done
By the time you hear this, I'll be basking in african sun
Like wow!
We made it
We here",english

The city fathers, they're trying to endorse
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse
But the town has no need to be nervous
The ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
To Jezebel the nun, she violently knits
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
At the head of the Chamber of Commerce
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes
Daddy's in the alley, he's lookin' for food
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues
The hysterical bride in the penny arcade
Screaming, she moans, ""I've just been made""
Then sends out for the doctor, who pulls down the shade
And says, ""My advice is to not let the boys in""
Now, the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride
""Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride
You will not die, it's not poison""
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes
Daddy's in the alley, he's lookin' for food
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues
Well, John the Baptist, after torturing a thief
Looks up at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief
Saying, ""Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?""
The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly
Saying, ""Death to all those who would whimper and cry""
And, dropping a barbell, he points to the sky
Saying, ""The sun's not yellow, it's chicken""
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes
Daddy's in the alley, he's lookin' for food
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues
The king of the Philistines, his soldiers to save
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves
Puts the pied pipers in prison and fattens the slaves
Then sends them out to the jungle
Gypsy Davey with a blowtorch, he burns out their camps
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him, he tramps
With a fantastic collection of stamps
To win friends and influence his uncle
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes
Daddy's in the alley, he's lookin' for food
I'm in trouble with the tombstone blues
The geometry of innocence, flesh on the bone
Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
At Delilah, who's sitting worthlessly alone
But the tears on her cheeks are from laughter
I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill
Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille
He could die happily ever after
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes
Daddy's in the alley, he's lookin' for food
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
And the National Bank at a profit sells road maps for the soul
To the old folks' home and the college
Now, I wish I could write you a melody so plain
That could hold you, dear lady, from going insane
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
Of your useless and pointless knowledge
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes
Daddy's in the alley, he's lookin' for food

Si me pasé con la sal no tiene remedio
Eso es lo que hago justo después de hacerlo
Hombre mudo antes que ciego

Pedir barril, haz el favor, pide uno lleno
Lo mejor significa barre tu terreno
Y si hay que soñar pues sueño
Son misiones en el cielo
Así piso el suelo
Así me quito el velo

They got no time for me
Just living in the city
Living on the bad streets
Sleeping in a balcony
They don't know we've been done
They don't know what, what we believe
We're getting down here with the people
Down with the gospel truth
Down in Boozophilia
Down with a broken tooth
We're on the south-side of Chicago
Down here in the groove
Down in West Virginia
Looking down with you
Me and little Anthony
We live in south Philly
We're living with Marie
She keeps me on the edge of my seat
Every time we be home
We don't know what she's gonna be doing
We don't know what we're gonna be talking

Looking down with you
I can open up a bakery
Maybe that's just what I need
A little of your paternity
A banjo on my knee
I don't care what we do
We can go to the beach
We can go get stoned

90,Wherever Is Your Heart,The President's Summer Playlist: Day,"I think it's time we found a way back home
You loose so many things you love as you grow
I missed the days when I was just a kid
My fear became my shadow, I swear it did
Wherever is your heart I call home
Wherever is your heart I call home
Though your feet may take you far from me, I know
Wherever is your heart I call home
You made me feel like I was always falling
Always falling down without a place to land
Somewhere in the distance I heard you calling
Oh it hurts so bad to let go of your hand
Wherever is your heart I call home
Wherever is your heart I call home
Though your feet may take you far from me, I know
Wherever is your heart I call home
Even when you're high, you can get low
Even with your friends you love, you're still alone
We always find the darkest place to go
God forgive our minds, we were born to roam
Wherever is your heart I call home
Wherever is your heart I call home
Though your feet may take you far from me, I know
Wherever is your heart I call home
Oh God forgive my mind, oh God forgive my mind
When I come home, when I come home
Oh God forgive my mind
There's a road that's long and winding, it hollers home
I'm calling home
Oh God forgive my mind, oh God forgive my mind
When I come home, when I come home
Oh God forgive my mind, oh God forgive my mind
When I come home, when I come home
Wherever is your heart I call home

91,Good Day,The President's Summer Playlist: Day,"Let's begin now
I woke up this morning and I said
You know instead of waitin' for a good day to happen, you know
Waitin' around through up's and down's, you know
We're gonna have
We're gonna have
We're gonna have a good day
And all my homies gonna ride today
And all these mommies look fly today
And all we wanna do is get by today
Heyyy
We're gonna have a good day
And ain't nobody gotta cry today
'Cause ain't nobody gonna die today
You save that drama for another day
Heyyy we're gonna have a good day
Hairline fresh, new cologne on
Feelin' so good changed the color to my phone
Orange kool-aid go good with patron
A naw hell naw boy still my ring tones
Free car wash had to clean up the Dodge
Get back when I can just playin' my part
Church folk had a fish fry
Mustard, hot sauce, light bread, and french fries
Love for the big guy
Hit the park, boys showin' off their hops
Nappy Roots on the radio and you know it bops
Last night I hit the pick tree bought some Air Force ones
Four tall tees man I'm lovin' bein' a G
We're gonna have a good day
And all my homies gonna ride today
And all these mommies look fly today
And all we wanna do is get by today
Heyyy
We're gonna have a good day
And ain't nobody gotta cry today
'Cause ain't nobody gonna die today
You save that drama for another day
Heyyy we're gonna have a good day
We're gonna have a good day
And I ain't finna worry bout what nobody say
I'm still above ground that's the reason I pray
Got my car cleaned up now I'm ready to play
Make a call to the sticks say I'm headin' dat way
Heard my cousin cookin' out I gotta get me a plate
Got this new outfit ain't even out in the States
So if they ain't speakin' to soon but this is a hell of a day
And these Dickies got me sittin' in a hell of a place
Got my stunna shades on and a grin on my face
My grill looks mean but I swear I'm straight
And the hood showin' love so I'm a okay
We're gonna have
We're gonna have
We're gonna have a good day
And all my homies gonna ride today
And all these mommies look fly today
And all we wanna do is get by today
Heyyy
We're gonna have a good day
And ain't nobody gotta cry today
'Cause ain't nobody gonna die today
You save that drama for another day
Heyyy we're gonna have a good day
We might as well do what the children sayin'
Take the day off hit park and just hang
Barbeque, roll a few and put up your dukes
And if it's beef, put the peace up and put down your dukes
It's time to change our ways
So we can save the day
For the children sake and make a better place to play
And if it's all good break out your group and grip your wood
And if you ridin' dirty just light your spliff and blow your
But do it real big exactly like a player should
Enjoy your twentyfour's, do your thang and rep your hood
The world is all yours
But still we all bound forever
In a day the choice you make is relly all fine
We're gonna have a good day
And all my homies gonna ride today
And all these mommies look fly today
And all we wanna do is get by today
Heyyy
We're gonna have a good day
And ain't nobody gotta cry today
'Cause ain't nobody gonna die today
You save that drama for another day
Heyyy we're gonna have a good day
And all my homies gonna ride today
And all these mommies look fly today
And all we wanna do is get by today
Heyyy
We're gonna have a good day
And ain't nobody gotta cry today

Shake just a little now girl
Dying to meet you, so let's mess around
I've got an obsession of us getting down
Come just a little bit closer
I just need permission so just

But if I can be your buddy, help you study and get your head right

I told her let's go, let's blow this lame nigga factory
She said, What type of girl do you think I are
The kind that you meet in a bar
You think you can get whatever you want cause you some kinda star
No I'm a comet, I just want you woman
Hey, If I were you then It would be me that I go home with
Three, the one and only, one thing you ain't considered
I heard you when you told your girl ""ooh he can get it"" admit it,
You did it let's hop a cab and split it
I'm kiddin' we both going to where you livin'
Ha, I got you gigglin' like I'm piglet
Oh that's the ticket, I hope you are more like Anita Baker than Robin Givens
No, I don't know that lady so let me quit it
I'm just style freein', freestylin' with y'all seldom do
This is what I'm telling you
To the bed I'm nailing you
Like I've been in jail for two
Years and then they let me loose

95,Down Down The Deep River,The President's Summer Playlist: Day,"Spit into the center of your hometown, there are leaves in the street,
and there are friends around you now. All the days of your life in a line.
All the way it seemed by 89
But it's not all right. It's not even close to all right.
Down a hall in your house, down a road in December
(Down, down, down the deep river, down, down, down the deep river)
Down a hall in your house, down a road in December
(Down, down, down the deep river, down, down, down the deep river)
We lie awake at night in a tent and I say,
Tell me about your uncle and his friend
because they seem like very bad men.
Well we oughtta keep away from them.
Bend in the road back there, we saw the place to go.
Tell me 'bout the greatest show or the greatest movie you know
or the greatest song that you taped from off the radio.
Play it again and again it cuts off at the ending though.
Tell me I'm always gonna be your best friend.
Now you said it one time, why don't you say it again?
All the way down the line to where the telephone ends
come on and shout it on down the wire.
And it's not all right.
It's not even close to all right.
Down a hall in your house, down a road in December
(Down, down, down the deep river, down, down, down the deep river)
Down a hall in your house, down a road in December
(Down, down, down the deep river, down, down, down the deep river)
And as the rescue party, the volunteer team ah,
they're just kids of eighteen, and it's the worst thing
they've seen they're standing all around that tree,
and I'm so sorry that I can't stop crying.
Shivering from the late fall cold,
I felt like a solid ghost.
I ran and then I couldn't slow.
My father found me though, my father took me home.
He said, Oh, son, I saw you get knocked down,
and I ran out I bet your head was spinning.
With that bright pain you stunned,
when you've only just begun to be only just beginning.
Tossed in the viper pit, all those feelings and fears,
and all that difficult shit in all those tender years.
There was something in the air; something gathered in the air.
Something singing in the wind.
I'll be your fighter and you'll be my mirror.
And you'll be all right because I'll be right here.
Oh kid, now I'm not going anywhere.
I swear I'll try to not be going anywhere.
Though it's not all right. It is so far from all right.
We'll make it into a choice somehow.
I don't know, but you'll have a choice somehow.
Down a hall in your house, down a road in December
(Down, down, down the deep river, down, down, down the deep river)
We can never go back; we can only remember
(Down, down, down the deep river, down, down, down the deep river)
Maybe they told you 'bout the summer sky,
maybe they said there's a great gold spirit in the summer sky
or all your friends (all your best, best friends)
are gonna gather around your bed at night.
Well that'll make it all right because it is still so far from all right. Oh, kid, I know.
Down a hall in your house, down a road in December
(Down, down, down the deep river, down, down, down the deep river)
Up the stairs four flights, son; can you feel my heart shiver?
(Down, down, down the deep river, down, down, down the deep river)
Wakin' in the dawn with that dream getting dimmer and dimmer.
I said, Are we going down the deep river? Down the deep river?
Why don't you say you still see it, say you remember? Are we going down?
Are we going down the deep river? Because I know it's scary, baby.",english

I can never leave the past behind
I can see no way, I can see no way

And I'm ready to suffer and I'm ready to hope

That feels different
From when your hands are in mine
That's just the way it is
And when my voice is screaming out to my own ears, hmm
That feels different from when I hear yours

And when I'm standing in this mirror after all these years
What I'm viewing is a little different
From what your eyes show you

And straight into my arms you will run
And when you come my heart will be waiting
To make sure that you're never alone
There and then all my dreams will come true, dear
There and then I will make you my own

Was everything a man could want to do
I could never see tomorrow, but I was never told about the sorrow

How can you stop the rain from falling down?
How can you stop the sun from shining?
What makes the world go round?
How can you mend a this broken man?
How can a loser ever win?
Please help me mend my broken heart and let me live again
I can still feel the breeze that rustles through the trees
And misty memories of days gone by
We could never see tomorrow, no one said a word about the sorrow
And how can you mend a broken heart?
How can you stop the rain from falling down?
How can you stop the sun from shining?
What makes the world go round?
How can you mend this broken man?
How can a loser ever win?
Please help me mend my broken heart and let me live again",english

Bury my feet, bury my feet in the sand
There's a hole, it's twelve miles deep, I dug it
with my hands
Come on lie next to me
I'll sing you to sleep, I'll sing you to sleep,
There's a band on the boardwalk, you're tapping your feet
but I'm too drunk to dance
Black and blue all on my face, I wanna follow you
home, I wanna see your place,
I wanna take you in my arms, float down a river with
you, I wanna buy the farm
Come on let's run away
baby let's go, let's go,
There's a southbound train pulling out at nine - leave
this jukebox joint behind
Come on let's have one more
I don't wanna go, I'm not ready to go,
I'm scared of the way my heart gets sore from
wondering if you're mine
Come on, let's jump in
the water is cold, it's gonna be cold,
But the feeling I get when you touch my skin hmmm it
makes me bold
Come on - let's kiss
in the July sun beneath the July sky,
Oh the feeling I get when you pass me by

the water to touch my toes,

111,Suzanne,The President's Summer Playlist: Night,"Suzanne takes you down to her place near the river
You can hear the boats go by, you can spend the night forever
And you know that she's half-crazy but that's why you want to be there
And she feeds you tea and oranges that come all the way from China
And just when you mean to tell her that you have no love to give her
Then he gets you on her wavelength
And she lets the river answer that you've always been her lover
And you want to travel with her, and you want to travel blind
And you know that she will trust you
For you've touched her perfect body with your mind
And Jesus was a sailor when he walked upon the water
And he spent a long time watching from his lonely wooden tower
And when he knew for certain only drowning men could see him
He said all men will be sailors then until the sea shall free them
But he himself was broken, long before the sky would open
Forsaken, almost human, he sank beneath your wisdom like a stone
And you want to travel with him, and you want to travel blind
And you think you maybe you'll trust him
For he's touched your perfect body with her mind
Now, Suzanne takes your hand and she leads you to the river
She's wearing rags and feathers from Salvation Army counters
And the sun pours down like honey on our lady of the harbor
And she shows you where to look among the garbage and the flowers
There are heroes in the seaweed, there are children in the morning
They are leaning out for love and they wil lean that way forever
While Suzanne holds her mirror
And you want to travel with her, and you want to travel blind
And you know that you can trust her
For she's touched your perfect body with her mind",english

Whatever it takes to make it right
No matter how hard, I will fight for you

That something so simple still escapes us
While anger and pride cloud your eyes

Yea, ain't no love in the heart of city, that's what they told me
Beefing over 100 niggas, don't none of 'em know me
Son of a mother studying at UDC
Sitting in taxi cabs, where daddy roaming the streets
Seven hallelujahs, my sutana was clean
On everything I weared all the America's tees
This whole system the most prolific in the DMV
Listen when you get the keys to sell em you don't get the beef
Make a nigga wanna get the piece to get the peace
You gon' need more than Wikipedia to get to me
PG to Mo County bet they all know about me
Every hood, every 'burb, I got superb balance
From the city that made me love you forever for it
Hope you celebrate every moment forever ignore it
You made me what I am, you made me what I'm not
They gon' love you a little different when you at the top
Give me love, baby
Not enough, not enough, just a touch, baby
What the fuck, baby? It's just us, baby
This ain't right, this is life
This a love hate thing
Give me love, baby
Not enough, not enough, just a touch, baby
What the fuck, baby? It's just us, baby
This ain't right, this is life
This a love hate thing
Hold me tight, let me go
Heal my heart, hurt my soul
Build me up, break me down
Make me smile, make me frown
Give me love, take it all away again
Give me love, take it all away again
Yeah, my affinity grows as the city gets cold
As you reaching your goals, you gon' meet you some foes
Having dinner with Leonsis I'm dreaming to own
But for now me and my homies see the bottom floor
I'm trying to redefine the culture, and a bigger soul
Women in town but I manifestating every goal
I see potential in John, talk to him once a week
Media targeting our city in This Week
I lost a lot of friends, and they ain't even dead
When I was on my way up why you ain't see the stairs
Lord father if I opted to follow them
My heart would tear from my dreams let me know that you here
And it's rare when I'm anywhere with too many heads
Niggas jealous and never tell it until they stare?
How could you blame us envy
We do the same thing for a living
Know the same niggas but they all commend me
Champagne I'mma spill it until we all fill up
Maybe it stopped me from giving a fuck about opinions
Probably not but I'm temperorary out of fizucks
So tell the post to leave propaganda to politicians
Hold me tight, let me go
Heal my heart, hurt my soul
Build me up, break me down
Make me smile, make me frown
Give me love, take it all away again
Give me love, take it all away again",english

121,Elevator Operator,The President's 2016 Summer Playlist: Day,"Oliver Paul, twenty years old
Thick head of hair, worries he's going bold
Wakes up at quarter past nine
Fair evades his way down the 96 tram line
Breakfast on the run again, he's well aware
He's dropping soy linseed Vegemite crumbs everywhere
Feeling sick at the sight of his computer
He dodges his way through the Swanston commuters
Rips off his tie, hands it to a homeless man
Sleeping in the corner of a metro bus stand and he screams
I'm not going to work today
Going to count the minutes that the trains run late
Sit on the grass building pyramids out of Coke cans
Headphone wielding to the Nicholas building
He trips on a pothole that's not been filled in
He waits for an elevator, one to nine
A lady walks in and waits by his side
Her heels are high and her bag is snakeskin
Hair pulled so tight you can see her skeleton
Vickers perfume on her breath
A tortoise shell necklace between her breasts
She looks him up and down with a botox frown
He's well used to that look by now
The elevator dings and they awkwardly step in
Their fingers touch on the rooftop button
Don't jump little boy, don't jump off that roof
You've got your whole life ahead of you, you're still in your youth
I'd give anything to have skin like you
He said, I think you're projecting the way that you're feeling
I'm not suicidal, just idling insignificantly
I come up here for perception and clarity
I like to imagine I'm playing SimCity
All the people look like ants from up here
And the wind's the only traffic you can hear
He said All I ever wanted to be
Was an elevator operator, can you help me please?
Don't jump little boy, don't jump off that roof
You've got your whole life ahead of you, you're still in your youth
I'd give anything to have skin like you
Don't jump little boy, don't jump off that roof
You've got your whole life ahead of you, you're still in your youth
I'd give anything to have skin like you",english

124,Tightrope - The Solo Version,The President's 2016 Summer Playlist: Day,"Whoaaa!
Another day (adabadee, nigga)
I take your pain away
Some people talk about ya like they know all about ya
When you get down they doubt ya
And when you tip it on the scene, yeah they talkin' bout it
Cause they can't tip on the scene
They just talk about it, t-t-t-talk bout it
When you get elevated
They love it or they hate it
You dance up on them haters
Keep getting funky on the scene
While they jumpin' round ya
They trying to take all of your dreams
But you can't allow it
Cause baby whether you're high or low
Whether you're high or low
You gotta tip on the tightrope (tip, tip on it)
T-t-t-tip on the tightrope (tip, tip on it)
Baby, baby, baby, whether you're high or low (high or low)
Baby whether you're high or low (high or low)
You got to tip on the tightrope (tip, tip on it)
Now let me see you do the tightrope (tip, tip on it)
And I'm still tippin' on it
See I'm not walkin' on it
Or tryin to run around it
This ain't no acrobatics
You either follow or you lead, yeah
I'm talkin' bout ya
Keep on blaming the machine, yeah
I'm talkin' bout it
T-t-t-talkin' bout it
I can't complain about it
I gotta keep my balance
And just keep dancin on it
We gettin funky on the scene
Yeah you know about it

Tip on the tightrope (tip, tip on it)
Baby let me see you tight rope (tip, tip on it)
And I'm still tippin' on it
You gotta keep your balance
Or you fall into the gap
It's a challenge but I manage
Cause I'm cautious with the strap
Do damage to your cabbage that
A doctor cannot patch
Why you don't want no friction
Like the back of a matchbook
Daddy Fat Sax will fold you
And your MacBook
Close shows, shut you down
Before we go-go backwards
Act up, and whether we high or low
We gonna get back-up
Like the Dow Jones and NASDAQ
Sorta like a thong in an ass crack
Come on
I tip on alligators and little rattlesnakers
But I'm another flavor
Something like a terminator
Ain't no equivocating
I fight for what I believe
Why you talkin' 'bout it
J-j-just talkin' 'bout it
Some callin' me a sinner
Some callin' me a winner
I'm callin' you to dinner
And you know exactly what I mean
Yeah I'm talkin bout you
You can rock or you can leave
Watch me tip without you
N-n-now whether I'm high or low
(High or low)
Whether I'm high or low
(High or low)
I'm gonna tip on the tightrope
(Tip, tip on it)
Mmm
(Tip, tip on it)
Baby, baby, baby
Whether I'm high or low
(High or low)
High or low
(High or low)
I got to tip on the tightrope
(Tip, tip on it)
Now baby tip on the tightrope
You can't get too high
(You can't get too high)
I said you can't get too low
(We can't get too low)
Cause you get too high
(You can't get too high)
No, you'll surely be low
(No, you'll surely be low)
1, 2, 3, ho!
Yeah, yeah
Now shut up, yeah
Yeah, now put some voodoo on it
Ladies and gentlemen, the funkiest horn section in Metropolis
Yeah, oh
We call that classy brass
Ohh ohh
Oh!

If I play the ukulele
Just like a little lady
Do you mind?
If I play the ukulele

127,Forever Begins,The President's 2016 Summer Playlist: Day,"Victory won in a worlds of Hennessey and guns
Too young for the marches but I remember these drums
To start reality of wars and battles we fought for ours
Caught in ghetto tragedy
I talk to my aunt named Mattie Lee
And recognize the importance of family
Hand me a joint, good music and room to breathe
Those that doubt Com' will soon believe
Can't trust the weave, my lady had one
I'm more like a fool for soul and passion
The price of gas rises, street life is pumpin' fast
Lives is I'm watch [Incomprehensible]
And realize that we all survivors
No religion or race, whatever describe us
My guys do dirt, do dirt but never really talk about it
Forever begins just because I thought about it
Livin' once again
We livin' then you go
Livin' then you go
Livin' then you go
Livin' then you go
Ashes and snowfalls, I wonder when the roll call
For heaven gon' come, forever gon' come
It's a cold world and I can never go numb
Look fear in the eyes, say I'm never gon' run
Sooner or later I know the cheddar gon' come
For now I write the world letters to better the young
On tree by jury, together we hung
Now we let our chains hang and gang bang to maintain
'Ghanastan goin' through the same thing
It trickles down at each other, we aim pain
I shoot for stars, peace and exclusive cars
Through the while I learned to earn hard
Watch gangstas turn God into Mr. War
No matter how much I elevate, I kiss the floor
It was in the van when she said Dilla was gone
That's when I knew we'd live forever through song
Livin' once again

You and I've been here forever
Thirty years old red eyes, beholdin' red eyes
I see my world's tears, yeah, origin is forever
Every peak will have two valleys
Hopeful eyes in the comfort of true protection
And admiration of the chime, that's forever
Forever is to strive the pace of endearment
Forever, forever is what I'd leave
My I self contribution, damn, what I'm gon' leave?
Okay, I leave my one and only grain of spiritual sand
To the universal scales of humanity, all humanity
Forever is findin' a solution to a solution
Tsunamis, hurricanes, followin' the trails of the African slave ships
War, war and more war
Floods, Columbine, global warming, earthquakes
Another somebody done me wrong, son
Virginia Tech, there's not a oh, what the heck
We're still, did you place your one grain
Of spiritual sand forever?

129,As We Enter,The President's 2016 Summer Playlist: Day,"As we enter, come let we take you on to dig this adventure
Must be dementia that you ever thought you could touch our credentials
What's the initials? Q-B Jamrock the lyrical officials
Send out the order, laws, and the rituals
Burn candles, say prayers, paint murals
It is truth we big news we hood heroes
Put ass to anchor, we come to conquer
I not badman, we not play Willy Wonka
And I got the guns, I got the ganja
And we could blaze it up on your block if you want to
Or haze it up stash-box in a Hummer
Or you could run up and get done up
Or get something that you want none of
Unlimited amount you collect from us
Direct from us, street intellectuals
And I'm shrewd about decimals and my man'll speak Patois
And I can speak rap star, y'all feel me
Even if it's in Swahili or body Ghani
Masuri Sana, switch up the language and move to Ghana
Salute and honor, real revolution rhymers
Rhythm piranhas, like two Obamas, unfold the drama
Word is out, hysteria you heard about
Nas and Jr. Gong came to turn it out
Body the verses till they scream ""murder"" out
The kings is back time to return the crown
Who want it? Tuck your chain, we're due coming
Renegades that'll peel you back like new hundreds
Bet your jewels on it you don't want to lose on it
Either move on or move on it
Queens to Kingston gunshot we use and govern the kingdom
Rise up to Winstead I can see the fear up in your eyes, realize you can die any instant
And I can hear the sound of your voice when you must lose your life like mice in the kitchen
Snitching, I can see him pissing on his-self and he wetting up his thighs and he trying to resist it
Switching, I can smell him digging up shit like a fly, come around, and keep persisting
That's how you end up in a hit list
In a bad man business
No evidence
Crime scene, fingerprint-less
Flow effortless
Casual like the weekends
No pressure when
We're comfy and decent
We set this off beasting
Hunting season
And, frankly speaking
Word is out, hysteria you heard about
Nas and Jr. Gong came to turn it out
Body the verses till they scream ""murder"" out

Word is out, hysteria you heard about
Nas and Jr. Gong came to turn it out
Body the verses till they scream ""murder"" out
The kings is back time to return the crown
Who want it? Tuck your chain, we're due coming
Renegades that'll peel you back like new hundreds
Bet your jewels on it you don't want to lose on it
Either move on or move on it",english

I'm in love so much; look what you've done
Please, don't whisper anything else in my ear
My body, my heart, and my soul is high
Let me find the strength to get on up outta here

Watching us give into our fears

No hope for a bright tomorrow

To give it up, no

I nearly cave in from the weight
I almost believe
Almost believe
All the sorrows will consume me
'til peace among men I never can see
But I'm not sure enough to give it up
I'll keep faith
Like so many souls who won't be drowned
By evil in the world
I have faith in mankind
That we can guide our choices towards a healthy world
In time to ease our bind
For only hard work through time
Can change men's minds, I know
If we make some small changes now
We'll heal ourselves, some way, some how
I don't expect to ever taste the fruit
My life devoted could bring forth
I almost believe
Well I do believe
Oh the path to peace is endless
So, choosing to close our eyes makes our faults mendless
Of this I'm sure enough
I won't give up

And I won't give up

That you'll make love to me
Strange as it seems
Someday we'll meet
And you'll dry all my tears
Then whisper sweet
Little things in my ear
Hugging and a kissing
Oh, what we've been missing
Lover man, oh, where can you be",english
147,Criminal,The President's 2016 Summer Playlist: Night,"I've been a bad, bad girl
I've been careless with a delicate man
And it's a sad, sad world
When a girl will break a boy
Just because she can
Don't you tell me to deny it
I've done wrong and I wanna suffer for my sins
I've come to you cause I need guidance to be true
And I just don't know where I can begin
What I need is a good defense
Cause I'm feelin' like a criminal
And I need to be redeemed
To the one I've sinned against
Because he's all I ever knew of love
Heaven help me for the way I am
Save me from these evil deeds before I get them done
I know tomorrow brings the consequence at hand
But I keep livin' this day
Like the next will never come
Oh help me, but don't tell me to deny it
I've got to cleanse myself
Of all these lies til I'm good enough for him
I've got a lot to lose
And I'm bettin' high so I'm beggin' you
Before it ends
Just tell me where to begin
What I need is a good defense
Cause I'm feelin' like a criminal
And I need to be redeemed
To the one I've sinned against
Because he's all I ever knew of love
Let me know the way
Before there's hell to pay
Give me room to lay the law and let me go
I've got to make a play
To make my lover stay
So what would an angel say
The devil wants to know
What I need is a good defense
Cause I'm feelin' like a criminal
And I need to be redeemed
To the one I've sinned against
Because he's all I ever knew of love",english

You make me smile with my heart
Your looks are laughable, un-photographable
Yet you're my favorite work of art
Is your figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak
Are you smart?
Don't change a hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay, little valentine, stay!
Each day is Valentine's Day
Don't change a hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay, little valentine, stay!
Each day is Valentine's Day",english

And know what you're thinking now
And if I were to need it, I need some kind of sign
Let me know 'cause I can't read your mind
Are you in? Or am I in this on my own?
I need some clue from you, let me know, babe
Do you feel you? Do you read me?
Tell me, am I gettin' through to you?
I wanna know, are you with me? Are you listening?
Baby, is my message gettin' through?
Do you feel me baby
Oh babe, 'cause I can feel you
You play it so cool
Won't let nothin' show through
Won't show what you're feeling now, no
And you like to keep keepin' me
Keeping me here in the dark
And I can't see through into your heart
Let me in, in on this mystery
'Cause I just can't stay in this guessing game
Do you feel you? Do you read me?
Tell me, am I gettin' through to you?
I wanna know, are you with me? Are you listening?
Baby, is my message gettin' through?

Oh babe, 'cause I can feel you
And don't keep me hanging on the line, baby
Tell me if you want me and if you don't just let me know
Just answer one question
Don't keep me here guessing, tell me now

Tell me, am I gettin' through to you?
I wanna know, are you with me? Are you listening?
Baby, is my message gettin' through?
